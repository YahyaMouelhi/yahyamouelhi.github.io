## Analysis

The goal of of this challenge is not really simple but it's not that hard too , there are three main things to consider beating in this challenge and after doing some **reverse engineering** to understand of the binary works , we will see that our main focus is here :

![main ghidra](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445062378088562913/image.png?ex=692efab6&is=692da936&hm=e3f90f159067ff6910fbcd58446e4308a01be7ff6e3240d0a7624ef7fefa90b3&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1832&height=744)

![endgame1 ghidra](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445061408684507247/image.png?ex=692ef9cf&is=692da84f&hm=82598dce82db32b78849bd1463e04020cf77dd040e678ea4f30464e966dff214&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1838&height=742)

![endgame2 ghidra](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445063894765932544/image.png?ex=692efc20&is=692daaa0&hm=c3bbb662f816c4ad818bdcb2b75a282423f8c2956ae1b895a8c663dea5c2d6f0&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1816&height=394)

![canary leak ghidra](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445058649314689155/image.png?ex=692ef73d&is=692da5bd&hm=32241c3b8c106a74e89cef204e5bb673cb77f14682894d2c13d2c2e3969cf0c1&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1438&height=733)

**Steps :**

1) Automation to answer the questions.
2) Leaking the canary and use it.
3) Bypassing strlen() by injecting a null byte so our bof works. 
4) Crafting syscalls to open , read and write the flag.txt because there's no really win function or system or whatever.

**Keep in mind** in this challenge i intentionally made spawning a shell and catting the flag.txt useless , if u try to do so u'll just get permission denied and only the binary can read the content of the flag.txt , i made this to get people to know more about alternative ways to get the flag.txt other than just spawning a shell ... This challenge isn't hard to be fair but can take some time to solve .

Let's run the basics commands **file and checksec** on the binary and see what we'll get :

![file and checksec output](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445066405891280896/image.png?ex=692efe77&is=692dacf7&hm=148df11c2a31149d70b129a71875e60757e2d8bd4cc1870abc92baadc65ee216&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1862&height=587)


Now let's start building the automation part because without it we can't fuzz and find and then leak our canary , from the previous pics inside ghidra we can see that the difference between our_variable and one the 
canaries is 0xb8 - 0x10 = 0xa8 , and remember we are working in 64 bit binary so every stack position will be 
8 bytes , meaning to find how many positions are there between us we need to divide the difference by 8 , so the offset between the canary and variable is 0xa8 / 8 = **21** , now all that's left we need to find our position in the stack and to do that we need to inject sthg , leak stack positions until we find a match , here's a visual example :

```bash
aaaaaaaa.%1$p.%2$p.%3$p.%4$p.%5$p.%6$p.%7$p.%8$p.%9$p
aaaaaaaa.%10$p.%11$p.%12$p.%13$p.%14$p.%15$p.%16$p.%17$p.%18$p.%19$p
aaaaaaaa.%20$p.%21$p.%22$p.%23$p.%24$p.%25$p.%26$p.%27$p.%28$p.%29$p
aaaaaaaa.%30$p.%31$p.%32$p.%33$p.%34$p.%35$p.%36$p.%37$p.%38$p.%39$p
aaaaaaaa.%40$p.%41$p.%42$p.%43$p.%44$p.%45$p.%46$p.%47$p.%48$p.%49$p
aaaaaaaa.%50$p.%51$p.%52$p.%53$p.%54$p.%55$p.%56$p.%57$p.%58$p.%59$p
```

Rmember our variable size is 64 byte and if we pass more read will pass the rest to the next input so we always need to send less than 64 byte , i automated the play part and when it asks us for our username , that's where the format string exploit is , then we press yes to see the scoreboard and see what we leaked :

![test1 leak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445068866639368414/image.png?ex=692f00c1&is=692daf41&hm=f97bd526448231feecc03ea1ef32def6cc146546cae16a6fe3c2ee02729b07a8)


![test2 leak](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445070001248665702/image.png?ex=692f01d0&is=692db050&hm=ebf94af3ab0d201d849621e04f7ddd83760f068118f43efc44913ccb3a28245c&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1682&height=751)

So we know our position in the stack and the offset from our position to the canary , now we just do the math , the canary position is 14+21 = **35** , let's test and see if we are correct or no :

![canary leak test](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445071046670553251/image.png?ex=692f02c9&is=692db149&hm=52b6b3b0525e725874974280daa20df7a381bacebb1afeb6ad096659de52decd&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1500&height=751)


As we can see we have successfully leaked the canary , the 33 is also the canary lol , just different offset and math , won't get in the details of how a canary works and why there is 2 in the stack but would recommend that you do ur own research if you are intrested !

Now after leaking the canary let's open gdb and calculate the offset we need to reach the **rip** , we will disassemble the function endGame since it's the one we are intrested in and see:

![gdb offset output](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445076211561664552/image.png?ex=692f0799&is=692db619&hm=c95b7a7ad88dfac1abca891fbf87ea72ca282e4031047c587652db9577f1acf6&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1862&height=474)

Now that we have our offset , the leaked canary we can start writing in the **rip** , remember that the offset to rip is = **offset to canary** + **canary** + **rbp** = **0xc8** === **0xd0** + **8** + **8** = **0xc8** and then comes the **rip** , let's use ropper and see what useful gadgets we have.

To not waste time i will directly shows the highlights and what gadgets we'll use

![ropper4 output](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445079754012102677/image.png?ex=692f0ae5&is=692db965&hm=a7c047be0eaa5e6eb6413bcf1edef2a92007fdae461bb4d300a34c914d0aebd9&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1862&height=336)

Woah what are all those gadgets ? wtf does xlatb or bzhi do or mean xD , we will cover all of them step by step so dw ! Here are the gadgets i highlighted together :

```bash
0x0000000000401289: xor rax, rax; ret;
0x0000000000401298: add rax, 0x69; ret;
0x0000000000401293: sub rax, 0x2b; ret;

0x00000000004012a3: pop rbx; pop r12; pop rbp; ret; 
0x000000000040127d: pop rcx; ret; 
0x000000000040127f: pop rdi; ret;  
0x0000000000401287: pop rdx; ret; 
0x0000000000401281: pop rsi; pop r12; ret;

0x000000000040129d: xlatb; ret; 
0x000000000040128d: bzhi rbx, rdi, rdx; ret;

0x000000000040129f: syscall; ret; 
0x0000000000401016: ret; 
```

So the first three gadgets are related to **rax** , we have **syscall ; ret** which allows us to do syscalls
if you don't know what a **syscall** is it's totally okay !

**In C programming on Linux, a "syscall" refers to the mechanism by which a user-space program requests a service from the operating system kernel. These services can include tasks like file I/O, process management, memory allocation, and more. We need to set the rax to the number of the function we wanna call , populate registers correctly and then syscall to call it.**

In our **ROP chain** we will call syscalls : **read** **open** and **write** the content of the 
flag.txt ( remember that spawning a shell will indeed spawn a shell but only the binary have the right permissions )

**Steps :**

1) pop gadgets will be used to populate correct arguments to each functions
2) syscall ret will call a function depending on what's inside the **rax**
3) The main plot twist is that we dont have direct access to **rax** , we have **xor** gadget which will set **rax** to 0 , **add** and **sub** some values to make it easier to edit it 
4) To indirectly populate **rax** with whatever we want we need to use **xlatb ; ret** gadget , what this gadget does is simply : **al = [al + rbx]** , if we can zero out rax ( we can using **xor rax rax**) will lead to : **al = [rbx]** , what's **al** ?? **al** is the lower byte of **rax** , and now we just need to figure out how to populate **rbx** ( we can use **pop** directly or **bzhi**) , **xlatb** loads the byte located inside the address that rbx points to , for example if **rbx** points to an address that have a char , the ascii order inside that region will be the value of **al** , in other words we need to set **rbx** to an **address** ( like .data or .bss) that have the character we wanna set al to it's ascii order , it might feel complex at first but it's really not once u understands it

We need to write inside **.bss** or **.data** , the character we want it's ascii code to be inside **rax** to call whatever syscall we want , and then save that address to **rbx** , zero out **rax** and execute **xlatb** which will save that number in **al** ( **rax** ) , example :

If we write **"-"** ( which have an ascii code = 45) inside **.bss** then save the address of **.bss** in **rbx** , then zero out **rax** and call **xlatb** : **al** = [**al** + **rbx**]  => **al** = [**0** + **rbx**] => **al** = [ **rbx** ] ==> **al** = **45**
and if we after use **sub_rax_0x2b** gadget the final **rax** value will be = **2** !! Which is the **syscall** number of **open**

To populate **rbx** with what we want we can either : **directly** populate it using pop gadget , or use **bzhi** to do so 
**FUN FACT** : i wanted to only provide the **bzhi** gadget but when i saw the **pop rbx** i left it and didn't wanna bother patching it xD , do ur research and understand how **bzhi** works  xD **;)**. 


And that's how we changed rax to what we wanted :D
----------
I recommend that you analyse it well and do ur research if something is not really clear and simple take ur time with it ...


Our goal is to :
----------

```c
int fd = open("flag.txt" , 0 , 0x40);
read(fd , .data , 0x100);
write(1 , .data , 0x100);
```

**open** will return a **file descriptor** , it will be stored in **rax** and we can guess it because we can't inspect what's inside **rax**  , **open** will open a file a return a **fd** pointing to it's start , by default it will start from **3** then **4** and more ... depending on the opened files in the program , in our program there is only one **open** (the one we executed) so it will definely be **3** !

We don't have the **flag.txt** inside the binary so we need to save it somewhere and use it when **opening** , you'll get used to the concept of writing what you'll need using read ( if **RELRO** is partial or none which is true in our case)

We already have **read** and we can grab it's address with gdb and directly use it from **plt** :

![read from gdb](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445097357879414824/image.png?ex=692f1b4a&is=692dc9ca&hm=5aaf6ad8a3fda06e2b7178c79be5ac551f03777ceffd920659974309f1ea6d9d&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1862&height=647)

And finally let's get **.bss** and **.data** addresses :

![data and bss](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1439691535397552128/1445097832196608121/image.png?ex=692f1bbb&is=692dca3b&hm=695355593aad87eba3d697b2a91b7c36ecfb6e79439a4a2747ba4ef7c3421aec&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1862&height=320)

## Exploitation / Solution

Now finally we can start writing the exploit script and this is what i ended up writing , it's really simple :

```python

from pwn import *
from time import sleep

context.arch = "amd64"
context.os = "linux"
context.binary = elf = ELF("./byterush")

# ----
# get 10+ score to access scoreboard ( automation )

#p = elf.process()
#p = remote("localhost" , 6110)
p = remote("tcp.espark.tn" , 6110)

p.recvuntil(b"? (yes/no)")
p.sendline(b"yes")

for i in range(12) :
    p.recvuntil(b"Target: ")
    ltr = p.recv().decode()[1:2]
    answ = str(ord(ltr)).encode()
    log.info(f"Recieved char = {ltr} . Sending {answ} ")
    p.send(answ)
    sleep(0.1)

p.sendline(b"0")

p.recvuntil(b"add yourself to the scoreboard ? (yes/no)")
p.sendline(b"yes")

# -----

# our variable is located in %12$p and its distance from canary = 0xb8 - 0x10 = 168  , meaning between us 168/8 = 21 stack position => canary located in %33$p

p.recvuntil(b"username champion ?")
p.sendline(b"%33$p")
p.recvuntil(b"see the scoreboard ? (yes/no)")
p.sendline(b"yes")
p.recvuntil(b"0x")
canary = int("0x" + p.recvline().decode().strip() , 16)
log.success(f"Leaked canary = {hex(canary)}")

# ----
# main payload ( rop chain )

```

If we run it we get this :
